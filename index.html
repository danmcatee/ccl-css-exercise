                    Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. At home you have unlimited time. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun If what you're doing doesn't make you happy
                    - you're doing the wrong thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every day I learn. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show
                    the light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. The least little bit can do so much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And maybe a little bush lives there. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Brown is such a nice color. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Let all these things just sort of happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here.
                </p>
                <p> I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.
