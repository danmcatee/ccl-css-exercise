          Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. At home you  have unlimited time. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're  doing these things. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun If    what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.
          Every day I learn. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. This present  moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Don't kill all  your dark areas - you need them to show the light.
          Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Don't hurry.   Take your time and enjoy. The least little bit can do so much.
          And maybe a little bush lives there. In your imagination you can go   anywhere you        want. Brown is such a nice color. Sometimes you   learn more from your mistakes       than you do from your masterpieces.    Let all these things just sort of happen.
          If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Work on one thing at   a time.         Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Decide   where your cloud lives.         Maybe he lives right in here.
          I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent   Red, and        a little bit of Prussian Blue. God gave you this gift of  imagination. Use it.       Clouds are free. They just float around the     sky all day and have fun.
