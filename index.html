          Just make a decision and let it go. Here's another little happy bush

        <p>
          It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? You have to allow
          the paint to break to make it beautiful. There is immense joy in just
          watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. You got your
          heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those great big fluffy clouds. A beautiful little sunset. All you have
          to learn here is how to have fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every time you practice, you learn more. This is the fun part I really
          believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa'
          with a two-inch brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other
          side now.
        </p>

        <p>
          We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Let all these things
          just sort of happen. That is when you can experience true joy, when
          you have no fear. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a
          mountain. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we
          have plenty of time. The secret to doing anything is believing that
          you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you
          can do. Anything. As long as you believe.
        </p>

        <p>
          Little short strokes. Let's make some happy little clouds in our
          world. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have
          power over is the garbage. It's almost like something out of a
          fairytale book. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any
          effort. Having a good day.
        </p>

        <p>
          From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless,
          my friends. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically
          - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Let's have a
          nice tree right here. You're meant to have fun in life.
